=====================

CMOO is an experimental MUD driver with the primary aim to allow parallel 
processing of client interaction while still providing strong consistency
to the logic running inside the driver.

The code is in a very early stage of development, and does not actually do
anything useful yet.

I would love to discuss aything related to this topic, so do not hesitate
