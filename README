=====================

CMOO is an experimental MUD driver with the primary aim to allow parallel 
processing of client interaction while still providing strong consistency
to the logic running inside the driver.

The code is in a very early stage of development, and can not be used for 
actual MOOs yet. 

Most of the documentation, where it exists, is inside the code or in the 
manual in the ./doc directory.

I would love to discuss aything related to this topic, so do not hesitate
