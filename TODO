=================

next main jobs
--------------
- new object creation in bytecode, oid to be use in call to net_make_listener from bytecode
  we can then remove the 0::init special args in vm
- more work to remove all the per-object/method cases in the vm and just call into eval
- eval work and assembler to allow echo server in actual bytecode
  - current opcodes support for strings
  - call/return, requires stub object stuff
  - getglobal/setglobal stubs

-> very basic, single-threaded "echo" type server

after basic case works
----------------------
- error handling in eval.c
- support for multiple threads
- load objects from file
- hashes/arrays
- div/idiv/mod
- jump_eq, jump_ne, jump_le, jump_lt
- floats
- inc/dec calls for ints

non-code
--------
- document vm evaluator and type system
- document stuff as we go along
