=================

next main jobs
--------------
- store does not throw away changes on rollback of TX
- work on compiler/grammar, full AST and what comes after (?)
- move compiler into main
- deadlock detector needs more tests and fixes
- currently you do not need to unlock a matching number of times when
  re-locking. this does not sound safe, but perhaps the store handles this?
- compiler should allow entry at top and at slot level
- logging from driver/core
- error handling in eval.c
- load objects from file
- arrays
-> towards "talker"
