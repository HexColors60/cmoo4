=================

next main jobs
--------------
- strings
- continue current syscall work to call into networking from bytecode
- vm pseudo-core to fetch objects and lock them, but still use the pseudo-core
  for actual execution
  - stub locking
  - stub persistence 
- eval work and assembler to allow echo server in actual bytecode
  - current opcodes support for strings
  - call/return, requires stub object stuff
  - getglobal/setglobal stubs

-> very basic, single-threaded "echo" type server

after basic case works
----------------------
- support for multiple threads
- hashes/arrays
- div/idiv/mod
- jump_eq, jump_ne, jump_le, jump_lt
- floats
- inc/dec calls for ints

non-code
--------
- document vm evaluator and type system
- document stuff as we go along
